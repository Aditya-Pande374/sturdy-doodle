#sturdy-doodle
This project serves as a valuable learning opportunity in various areas, including HTML Canvas, Sprite Sheet animations, Object-Oriented Programming, math and physics concepts, Collision Detection, and Gravity control.

Step-by-Step Approach:

1. Set up HTML, CSS, and JS files for the project.
2. Organize files and folders, including images, stylesheets, and sounds.
3. Create a Player class to establish the foundation for character interactions.
4. Define initial coordinates for the player within the game environment.
5. Implement background layers for an immersive visual experience.
6. Enhance player interaction with background layers to depict movement.
7. Introduce platforms (floors) to the game.
8. Improve interactivity with platforms, creating a dynamic gaming environment.
9. Implement collision detection mechanisms for a realistic gaming experience.
10. Integrate gravity control to enhance the game's dynamics.

To-Do List:

1. Incorporate sounds to add an auditory dimension to the game.
2. Integrate player sprites to bring the character to life visually.
3. Implement Sprite animations for a more dynamic and visually appealing experience.
4. Introduce obstacles and objects for enhanced interactivity and challenges.
5. Expand player-related features, such as jump, attack, running, climbing, to enrich gameplay.
